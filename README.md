# BIOM9541MA
Scripts to calculate the Anthropometric, Kinematic and Kinetic parameters of the MA
Steps to run this:

1) Place the script in the csv directory;eg (place rania.py in data/csv/rania/, place sam.py in data/csv/sam/) 
2) Access a Command line tool on your device (eg. Git bash, CMD) and direct to the directory of the script you wish to run.
Eg. On Git Bash this is done by running the commands:
        $ cd /path/to/the/directory/of/script
3) Allow the script to be run on your device (don't worry, there's nothing malicious in it). Eg:
        $ chmod 755 sam.py
4) Run the script by providing the name of a specific csv file for the analysis to run. Eg:
        $ ./rania.py Forward.csv
